# FrontEnd-Projects
Worked on a few Front End Projects using HTML , CSS Firstly and then JS.
Survey Form
This is a survey form project created using HTML and CSS. The form includes various questions and input fields for the user to fill out. The design is simple and easy to use, making it a great option for gathering information from a large number of people.

Getting Started
To get started, simply clone the repository and open the survey.html file in your browser. The form should be fully functional and ready to use.

Customizing the Form
If you would like to customize the form to better fit your needs, you can edit the HTML and CSS files directly. The form is built using a basic HTML structure, with CSS used for styling.

HTML
The form is built using a series of form and input elements. The label element is used to create the text for each question, and the input element is used to create the input field. You can add or remove questions as needed by editing the HTML directly.

CSS
The CSS file is used to style the form. It includes styles for the form layout, font, and colors. You can easily change the look and feel of the form by editing the CSS file.
